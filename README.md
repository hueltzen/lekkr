lekkr is an open-source shopping list web app licensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2](LICENSE).

lekkr tries to simplify keeping track of which groceries you need to get, by focusing on just that: your list of groceries. It is designed to be as minimal and stripped down as possible so you can just see what you need as fast as possible.

Since I believe that your data should stay your data everything in lekkr is stored in the local storage of your browser - no data is ever sent to the server. This not only protects your privacy but also improves performance and let's you use lekkr normally even when you have a bad or no internet connection (like in a store for example).
